## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently trying to get started! I'm still new to coding but I will do my best to advance quickly :)
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently a senior high school student, meaning I won't be able to be active much. But you can always write to me, I will check it once I'm available!
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: you can reach me through email, which is preferred, and also through Instagram, @autumnoodles but I don't use it much so again email is preferred 
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her
